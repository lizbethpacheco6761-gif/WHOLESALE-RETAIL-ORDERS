# WHOLESALE-RETAIL-ORDERS
The dataset for my final project is this wholesale &amp; retail one found from Kaggle. It shows transactional data from a sporting goods store from the years 2017-2021.  It includes information about the customers, the products, and the suppliers.

After downloading my files from Kaggle, I created a new database in DBeaver and imported the data.

My **PRIMARY KEY** from the product_supplier table is **Product ID**.
In the orders table the **PRIMARY KEY** is **Order ID** and the **FOREIGN KEY** is **Product ID**.
